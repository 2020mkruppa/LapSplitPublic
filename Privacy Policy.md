# Privacy Policy
LapSplit was built by Michael Kruppa as a free app with a focus on being lightweight and private, intended for use as is. This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Data if anyone decides to use our Service, the LapSplit app. Our Privacy Policy was created with the help of the [Privacy Policy Template Generator](https://www.privacypolicytemplate.net/) and [App Privacy Policy Generator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/).

## Data Collection
LapSplit does **not**:
- Collect, process, use, or store any Personal Data outside of the user's device whatsoever
- Share any Personal Data with any 3rd parties (because we don't collect it from the user's device)
- Process or use any Personal Data on the device for any purposes except the direct functionality of the app
- Use any 3rd party analytics solution
- Collect IP addresses
- Use cookies
- Require an internet connection at any point during its operation


## Local Data
All data generated by the user is only stored locally, on the user's device itself, and never transmitted off of it. This includes athlete names, event names, user preferences, and all timing results. This data is only ever used in the direct functionality of the app itself, as stated above, and never for any other purposes, such as advertising or analytics. Only the user will have access to this information; LapSplit developers (or any 3rd party) will not have any access to this. Athlete names are the only Personal Data we ask the user to optionally provide to identify the athletes for ease of timing. However, this information is never collected from the app and is not accessible by anyone except the user. 

Data is stored on the user's device indefinitely. If a user wants to fully delete all data, they can simply uninstall the app and reinstall it. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
